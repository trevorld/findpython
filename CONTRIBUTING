Pull requests are welcome but not guaranteed to be accepted (especially if they
break reverse compatibility).  It might be a good idea to submit an issue
asking whether such a feature would be accepted before writing a patch.

Additionally, although not required, adding a unit test illustrating a bug or
testing the new feature would be much appreciated.
